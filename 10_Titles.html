        Font is an extremely important part of how you communicate content to your user. As you are likely aware there are many different aspects to font, and with CSS you can explicitly style each aspect. This property sets the font face. There are a collection of Web safe fonts that generally each browser has agreed to support, but there is an infinite number of different fonts. The problem is they might not all look the way you want them to on different browsers.
